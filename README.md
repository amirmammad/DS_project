First we should find the most related doc to query.So we build a vector for query first and then we build vector of each paragraph of each doc and sum together and get the vector of each doc.(for building vectors we used tf and idf in some searching ranges.we wrote the ranges on top of each tf and idf method.)then we compared each doc vector with query vector(using cosine formula and sequence matcher) and at last found the most related doc to query.now when we found the doc we should find the most related paragraph.so we built the vector of pararaphs and a new vector for query(searching ranges for tf and idf of each vector has changed and we wrote the ranges on top of each tf and idf method)and we compared each paragraph vector with query vector(using cosine formula and sequence matcher) and at last we found the most related paragraph to query.
